# Covid_taxi_spread
This project was made using python and postresql.
The goal of the project was to analyse the propagation of covid-19 according to the trajectory of taxis, and the visualization of the taxis movement and contamination in the Portugal map.
Every time the aplication is run two random taxis are picked, one is the first ten taxis originate in Lisbon, and the other one is the first taxis originated in Porto. Then is created a map with the coordinates of every city and districts of portugal using matplotlib scatter plot, then is used the funcanimation from the matplotlib, in each iteration is calculated the probability of a taxi being contaminated and is updated in the map with color red or green in case of contamination or not. When two taxis are less then 50 meters of distance, the probability of contamination is calculated, by picking radomly withi a probaibility of 10% initially, but if the taxi is not picked as contaminated, his odds are increased each time by 10%.
